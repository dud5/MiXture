Subject: Phase 1 - Munoz: Multilanguage programs in OCaml and
JavaScript

Phase 1 Project Selection Status Report

Name: Eduardo Munoz

College: Magdalene

User Identifier: em487

Director of Studies: Dr John Fawcett

Please complete 1, 2 and 3 below.

1. Please write 100 words on your current project ideas.

The goal of my project idea is to implement interoperability between
OCaml and JavaScript: multilanguage programs.

The mechanisms this project will be based on are described (for an
ML-like calculus and a Scheme-like one) in
http://www.eecs.northwestern.edu/~robby/pubs/papers/toplas09-mf.pdf
. I intend to implement the "lump embedding" and "natural embedding"
(as described in that paper) as the core of the project.

Possible extensions are integrating OCaml with a browser, allowing
sending of JavaScript code from the server (multilanguage OCaml +
JavaScript) and the client.

The implementation will be done by writing extending the
OCaml compiler (lexer, parser, type-checker and code generator).

The main difficulty will be to integrate JavaScript's dynamic and
loose type system with the strictness of OCaml, without losing the
type-soundness of OCaml.

2. Please list names of potential project supervisors.

Tomas Petricek (tomas.petricek@cl.cam.ac.uk) has agreed to supervise
this project.


3. Is there any chance that your project will involve any computing
resources other than the Computing Service's PWF and software that is
already installed there, for example: your own machine, machines in
College, special peripherals, imported software packages, special
hardware, network access, substantial extra disc space on the PWF.

If so indicate below what, and what it is needed for.

I will complete most of the implementation on my own laptop.  I will
work with the OCaml compiler (open source) and will use a JavaScript
engine (not decided yet, but possibilities are rhino and v8).
